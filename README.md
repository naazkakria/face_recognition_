# Face_recognition_
Used opencv library, haarcascade classifier and KNN algorithm to make face recognition
* Face recognition
  * 1 Face detection Using haar cascade classifier
  * 2 Face data Saving dataset in new folder in npy form
  * 3 Face recognition Using OpenCV haar cascade  and KNN algorithm 

## What is Haar Cascade classifier ?
OpenCV provides a training method (see Cascade Classifier Training) or pretrained models,
You can do  detection using the cv::CascadeClassifier::detectMultiScale method, which returns boundary rectangles for the detected faces or eyes. There are various Xml files which you can use  in your models 
You can download required file from :- https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades

But in this project we will use -haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml
